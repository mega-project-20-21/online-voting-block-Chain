# ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN

This project is based on the concept of blockchain and also the concept related to it.

# INTRODUCTION

With the development of cryptography and Internet technology, electronic voting **(E-voting)** has gradually become a popular research direction. The concept of electronic voting appeared in 1981. In nearly forty years of development, security and privacy have always been the focus of electronic voting research. Aiming at the security of electronic voting, many researchers propose a large number of secure electronic voting schemes using various technologies such as informatics and cryptography

# ABSTRACT

In todays world the blockchain is an trending topic for new developing world.
Creating an environment to full-fill the basic requirement of E-Voting is indeed a challenge for long time. Blockchain, distributed peer to peer technology has wide range of applications from financial to non-financial sectors. It can be utilized in E-Voting system as well.
