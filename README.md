In nearly forty years of development, security and privacy have always been the focus of electronic voting research. Aiming at the security of electronic voting, many researchers propose a large number of secure electronic voting schemes using various technologies such as informatics and cryptography

# ABSTRACT

In todays world the blockchain is an trending topic for new developing world.
Creating an environment to full-fill the basic requirement of E-Voting is indeed a challenge for long time. Blockchain, distributed peer to peer technology has wide range of applications from financial to non-financial sectors. It can be utilized in E-Voting system as well.
